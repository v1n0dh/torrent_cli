# BitTorrent Client in Modern C++23

A high-performance, command-line BitTorrent client written in modern C++23, designed to efficiently download files from the BitTorrent network using asynchronous IO and multithreading. This client fully implements the BitTorrent protocolâ€™s core features, including torrent metadata parsing, tracker communication, peer management, and piece-wise file downloading.

## Features

- Full Bencode encoder and decoder for torrent metadata serialization and parsing.
- Asynchronous networking modules for tracker communication and peer-to-peer data exchange using standalone ASIO (non-Boost) library.
- Multi-threaded piece downloader with thread-safe work queues and synchronization mechanisms.
- Prioritized piece selection strategy combined with SHA-1 hash verification for robust data integrity.
- Efficient file mapping and reconstruction of multi-file torrents into their original folder and file structures.
- Timeout handling, retry mechanisms, and error recovery for stable peer connection management.
- Custom thread pool to optimize CPU and IO resource utilization and improve download throughput.
- Designed with modern C++23 features such as concepts, smart pointers, and atomic operations to ensure safe and clean code.

## Requirements

- C++23 compatible compiler (e.g., GCC 12+, Clang 15+, MSVC latest)
- Standalone ASIO library (https://think-async.com)
- OpenSSL library (for SHA-1 hashing)
- JsonCPP, CPR libraries

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v1n0dh/torrent_cli.git
cd torrent_cli
make
```

## Usage
```bash
Usage:
  torrent_cli [OPTION...]

  -h, --help              Print Usage
  -t, --torrent-file arg  .torrent file input location
  -f, --out-file arg      destination file location
```

## Limitations

- Magnet link support is not implemented at this time; only .torrent files are supported.
- Trackerless DHT peer discovery is currently not supported.
- No upload/seeding functionality yet; the client is focused on downloading only.
- Performance optimizations such as bandwidth throttling or piece rarity algorithms are minimal.
